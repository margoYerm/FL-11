                  <p>What is a more fun thing to do in New York City than to soar to the skies and see the city from above? You can hire a private helicopter just for you or join a pre-set tour which is a far more affordable option. There are day tours, night tours, some that go all the way to the Liberty Statue, others that fly over the river, either way, a helicopter tour is one of the coolest things to do in NYC.</p>

                  <p>The area started off as a rural Dutch community in the 17th century and flourished as the center of African American culture in the 1910s to 1930s. However, the Great Depression, brought an end to the area’s boom and the 60s and 70s were troubled, with riots and the death of Malcom X andMartin Luther King Jr leaving only the poor behind.</p>

                  <p>Today, Harlem is one of New York City’s most colorful neighbourhoods, a foodie destination (fried chicken waffles anyone?) and an eminently proud and heritage-rich part of Manhattan. So a visit is one of most fun things to do in New York City. And you know what is really cool and also very enlightening? Joining a gospel mass</p>
